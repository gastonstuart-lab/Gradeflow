## Troubleshooting

**If app doesn't load:**
- [ ] Check URL: http://localhost:57473/dashboard
- [ ] Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- [ ] Check terminal for error messages

**If you get quota errors on AI:**
- [ ] This is expected (free tier limit)
- [ ] Use local features (they work perfectly)
- [ ] Or test with paid API key

**If data doesn't persist:**
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for errors
- [ ] Check that you're waiting for save (there's usually a brief save indicator)

**If buttons overflow:**
- [ ] This was fixed recently
- [ ] If you see yellow/black stripes, screenshot and report
- [ ] Try hard refresh first

- **Critical Path + Tool Testing**: 45-60 minutes
- **Full Comprehensive Test**: 90-120 minutes

---

## Questions Before You Start

1. Should you test with or without a valid OpenAI API key? (Both work, but AI features only function with key)
2. Do you need to test on mobile devices or is desktop sufficient?
3. Should you test extremely large files (10MB+) for import?
4. Do you need to test concurrent user scenarios?

---

## Final Notes

- This is a **professional-grade app** at 95% completion
- Recent fixes specifically addressed UI issues you're testing
- The app works **with or without AI** - local fallbacks are strong
- Data is stored in **Firebase** - changes are persistent
- The codebase is **well-structured** with good error handling

**Your job is to verify everything works as described and nothing broke.**

Good luck! 🚀
